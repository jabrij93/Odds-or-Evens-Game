# Odds-or-Evens-Game
This game is designed in raw Java code. It is based on string method and if,else statement.
The game is similar to rock paper scissors. It is played  between two players, you versus the computer. Each  player will choose either "odds" or "evens". Once you  have chosen your side, you each choose a number  of fingers to play - 0 to 5. The winner is determined by whether the sum of your fingers is odd or even. Here's a clip of the game being played:  https://youtu.be/4ZOLs03vILs?t=1m  

For example, letâ€™s say you choose "evens". That means the computer gets "odds". You choose to play 2 fingers and the computer plays 3. 2 + 3 = 5, which is odd so the computer wins.
